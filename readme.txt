(We each contributed equally to this assignment)

- Graph uses Dijkstra's Algorithm to compute the shortest path. This is used to
  compute hops.
- test.txt is a text form of the given input in hardcoded form and in standard
  input form with expected results. You can copy and past the SI test into a new
  file and test standard input for yourself.
- The program reads from standard input and writes to standard output. To
  signify EOF press "ctrl-D"
